# Type inference notes

I'm going to implement bidirectional type inference, using an algorithm I
implemented previously here. I think it was based on a blog post that I
no-longer remember, but it might have been this:
https://thunderseethe.dev/posts/bidirectional-constraint-generation/.

This is the algorithm I previously implemented:
